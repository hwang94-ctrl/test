# Abstract Myth Generator

This site generates abstract shapes and patterns as a symbolic mythâ€”a way to visually fix moments of uncertainty. Use the controls to randomize, lock, and save unique visual moments.

## Usage

- **Randomize**: Generates a new pattern.
- **Lock**: Fixes the current pattern, preventing changes until unlocked.
- **Save**: Downloads the current canvas as an image.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `r` (randomize), `l` (lock/unlock), `s` (save).

## Symbolic Myth Concept

The site uses generative art to represent mythic symbols and patterns. "Fixing" a moment means stabilizing a fleeting visual uncertainty, making it memorable and meaningful.
